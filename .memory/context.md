# Project Context: Locksmith 🔐

## Current Focus
Initial setup of the `.memory` context system to enhance AI-assisted development.

## Active Tasks
- [x] Create `.memory` directory and populate with initial documentation.
- [x] Implement a system to auto-update context after significant changes.
- [x] Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with 100% biometric enforcement.
- [x] Establish mandatory 100% test coverage policy for new features.

## Recent Changes
- docs: prioritize Homebrew as preferred macOS installation method
- docs: link official OpenSSF Best Practices badge 12451
- docs: add OpenSSF badge justification crib sheet
- docs: finalize OpenSSF Best Practices (CII) compliance
- fix: remove disallowed CodeQL init from scorecard workflow

## Important Decisions
- **Context Persistence**: Decided to use the `.memory` folder for persistent AI-readable context.
- **Review Gating**: Implemented mandatory pre-commit gating for architectural compliance (v2 imports, memory zeroing, build tags).
- **Environment**: Recognized standard Bash environment for project automation.

## Open Questions
- **SHA Generation**: Need to run `make release` and update Homebrew SHAs once binaries are notarized.
- **Biometric Mocking**: Explore more standardized mocking patterns for native backends to maintain 100% coverage in CI.
